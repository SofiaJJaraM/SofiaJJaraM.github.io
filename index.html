        <p class="Introduction">I'm a 21-year-old university student at Universidad de los Andes. If I had to briefly describe myself, I'd say:</p>

        <ul class="ListAboutMe">
            <li>I'm currently in my third year at university, majoring in Computer Science (ICC).</li>
            <li>I've been studying at Universidad de los Andes since 2023.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="UniversityInfo">

            .
        </p>

        <p class="PersonalInfo">On a more personal note, I consider myself a highly creative and artistic person. I'm passionate about reading, music of all genres, drawing, and singing. My main strengths lie in arts and crafts, particularly in drawing and painting with different media like:</p>
        <ul class="ListArtMedia">
            <li itemid="Digital">Digital tools</li>
            <li itemid="Pencils">Colored pencils</li>
            <li itemid="Watercolors">Watercolors</li>
            <li itemid="Acrylics">Acrylics</li>
            <li itemid="Pastels">Pastels</li>
            <li itemid="Alcohol">Alcohol-based markers</li>
            <li itemid="Water">Water-based markers</li>
            <li itemid="Ink">Ink fountain pens</li>
            <li itemid="Ball">Ballpoint pens</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What led me to ICC was, first, a small setback with my original choice of Digital Animation, and second, a growing interest in AI, its functioning, and digital interfaces in general. I also enjoy the design side of it.</p>
